## Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Required |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| DATABASE_URL | PostgreSQL connection URL | Yes |
| CONFIGURATION | JSON string of badge definitions | Yes |

## Badge Configuration

The CONFIGURATION environment variable defines all available badges in the system. Each badge has:

- `badgeId`: Unique identifier for the badge
- `badgeName`: Display name of the badge
- `badgeDescription`: Detailed description of what the badge represents

When assigning badges to users, the system validates that the badge ID exists in this configuration.

## Error Handling

The API includes proper error handling for:
- Invalid badge IDs
- Missing required parameters
- Database connection issues
- Duplicate badge assignments
