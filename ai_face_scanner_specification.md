    // Camera preview with overlay for face detection
    // Real-time frame analysis
    // Capture button for analysis
}
```

#### Face Analysis UI
```kotlin
// Face scanning screen with camera view
class FaceScannerFragment : Fragment() {
    // Camera preview
    // Face detection overlay
    // Analysis progress indicator
    // Results display
    // Product recommendations
}
```

#### AR Try-On Component
```kotlin
// ARCore integration for makeup overlay
class ARMakeupView : GLSurfaceView() {
    // 3D face mesh rendering
    // Makeup texture application
    // Real-time color adjustment
    // Screenshot capture
}
```

### iOS (SwiftUI) Implementation

#### Camera Integration
```swift
// AVFoundation camera with face detection
struct FaceScannerView: UIViewRepresentable {
    // Camera session management
    // Face landmark detection
    // Real-time analysis
    // Capture functionality
}
```

```swift
struct FaceAnalysisView: View {
    @StateObject var scannerViewModel = FaceScannerViewModel()
    
    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            // Camera view
            // Detection overlay
            // Analysis results
            // Product recommendations
        }
    }
}
```
